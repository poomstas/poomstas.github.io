In this post, I document how I extended the features of my Smart Farm Raspberry Pi setup by installing the BME-680 sensor and the I2C LCD display, and writing some python code so the sensor readings are printed on the LCD screen.

The circuit diagram for the Raspberry Pi + BME-680 + LCD module looks like this:

Both the BME-680 and the LCD module use the I2C protocol. I2C protocol has 4 connections: `VCC`, `GND`, `SCL` and `SDA`. Each connection's functionality and an explanation of the communication bus can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C). Both devices use 3.3V for the `VCC`, and the `SCL` and `SDA` lines can be connected in parallel to Raspberry Pi's natively supported GPIO pins (see diagram). `GND` is also connected to Pi's `GND`.



## BME-680 Sensor: Driver Installation & Setup

[This GitHub repo](https://github.com/pimoroni/bme680-python) provides the drivers to easily control the BME-680 breakout board. Full installation of the BME-68x drivers is done using this command: `curl https://get.pimoroni.com/bme680 | bash`. For manual install, see the repo's `README.md`. I did the full install:

The drivers seem to be installed correctly. Look at `examples` folder in [this repo](https://github.com/pimoroni/bme680-python) has great scripts to check whether the sensor was installed correctly. One example is posted below.

```python
import bme680
import time

print("""read-all.py - Displays temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas.
Press Ctrl+C to exit!
""")

try:
    sensor = bme680.BME680(bme680.I2C_ADDR_PRIMARY)
except (RuntimeError, IOError):
    sensor = bme680.BME680(bme680.I2C_ADDR_SECONDARY)

# These calibration data can safely be commented
# out, if desired.

print('Calibration data:')
for name in dir(sensor.calibration_data):

    if not name.startswith('_'):
        value = getattr(sensor.calibration_data, name)

        if isinstance(value, int):
            print('{}: {}'.format(name, value))

# These oversampling settings can be tweaked to
# change the balance between accuracy and noise in
# the data.

sensor.set_humidity_oversample(bme680.OS_2X)
sensor.set_pressure_oversample(bme680.OS_4X)
sensor.set_temperature_oversample(bme680.OS_8X)
sensor.set_filter(bme680.FILTER_SIZE_3)
sensor.set_gas_status(bme680.ENABLE_GAS_MEAS)

print('\n\nInitial reading:')
for name in dir(sensor.data):
    value = getattr(sensor.data, name)

    if not name.startswith('_'):
        print('{}: {}'.format(name, value))

sensor.set_gas_heater_temperature(320)
sensor.set_gas_heater_duration(150)
sensor.select_gas_heater_profile(0)

# Up to 10 heater profiles can be configured, each
# with their own temperature and duration.
# sensor.set_gas_heater_profile(200, 150, nb_profile=1)
# sensor.select_gas_heater_profile(1)

print('\n\nPolling:')
try:
    while True:
        if sensor.get_sensor_data():
            output = '{0:.2f} C,{1:.2f} hPa,{2:.2f} %RH'.format(
                sensor.data.temperature,
                sensor.data.pressure,
                sensor.data.humidity)

            if sensor.data.heat_stable:
                print('{0},{1} Ohms'.format(
                    output,
                    sensor.data.gas_resistance))

            else:
                print(output)

        time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
```

Running the above code gives me the following result, which tells me that the driver installation was successful.

## I2C LCD Screen: Driver Installation & Setup

The installation of the I2C LCD screen driver involved only accessing the [driver file](https://gist.github.com/DenisFromHR/cc863375a6e19dce359d#file-rpi_i2c_driver-py) from DenisFromHR's repo. Once the file is in the working directory, it is simply a matter of importing driver in python. It can be used like below:

```python
import I2C_LCD_driver

mylcd = I2C_LCD_driver.LCD()

mylcd.lcd_display_string("Neither Smart,", 1) # Line 1
mylcd.lcd_display_string("nor a Farm. Yet.", 2) # Line 2
```

The LCD can show up to two lines of text, and up to 16 characters per line. Anything beyond 16 characters for a line is cut off. Something to keep in mind when formatting the string data later on.



## Putting the Two Together

Let's read the data from the BME-680 sensor, and print it in a formatted string on the LCD screen. The code is simply the above two code snippets combined together, with some string formatting before the data is sent to the screen. It is found [here](https://github.com/poomstas/SmartFarm/blob/main/multiple_components/SensorDisplay.py). The main loop that reads the sensor data and prints it to the screen is below. Note that I paid special attention to the number formatting so that it honors the character constraint of the screen.

```python
try:
    while True:
        if sensor.get_sensor_data():
            temp, pressure, humidity = sensor.data.temperature, sensor.data.pressure, sensor.data.humidity
            temp, pressure, humidity = round(temp, 1), round(pressure, 1), round(humidity, 1)
            output = '\t{0:.1f} C,\t{1:.1f} hPa,\t{2:.1f} %RH'.format(temp, pressure, humidity)

            output1 = '{0:.1f}C {1:.1f}hPa'.format(temp, pressure)
            output2 = '{0:.1f}%RH '.format(humidity)

            if sensor.data.heat_stable:
                output2 += '{:4.1f}kOhms'.format(round(sensor.data.gas_resistance/1000, 1))
                print("\t" + output1 + " " + output2)
            else:
                print(output)

            mylcd.lcd_display_string(output1, 1) # 1st line on display
            mylcd.lcd_display_string(output2, 2) # 2nd line on display

        time.sleep(1)
```

## Results

The LCD display now prints out the sensor values read from BME-680. I can change the update frequency in `time.sleep()` method on the last line so that the LCD values are updated at time intervals other than 1 second.
